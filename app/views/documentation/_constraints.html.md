## Constraints

The software must comply with a minimum hardware requirement for each of the platforms it will operate on; meaning it should run fluidly on PC, tablet and mobile. The software system should be designed with the constraints of each of these operating systems in mind.

As well as hardware requirements, we have to cater for the dimensional constraints of the interfaces. We have to ensure we cater for the various screen sizes in a responsive and cohesive way, providing a fully featured system on all platforms.

The software, after being verified as completely functional, will be multilingual. The first iteration of the software will be an English-only system to ensure that all the core dependencies are fully operational. The primary concern of having a fully operational system supersedes the need for multiple languages for this particular software based on its user base.

All the data being transferred between the user and the system must be transmittable through Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or File Transfer Protocol (FTP), as the system is web-based and they are the two protocols adopted by the team.

Traditional programming conventions will have to be maintained throughout the system, with adequate supporting documentation, as the system will be solely maintained by the Parks and Wildlife Service after development completion.

Administrative implementation constraints involve preventing general users from accessing the more secure parts of the system such as user accounts and report generation.
