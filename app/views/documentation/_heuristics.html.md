## Heuristic Evaluation

* Visibility of system status: The system has been designed to return notice and error messages after task completion and show progression status during long load periods to keep users informed of the system's status.
 
* Match between system and the real world: The system has been designed with very colloquial notices and error messages that still stick to standards but carry a very young and fresh vibe. No system-oriented language or terms are shown to the user and all content appears in a logical, natural order.

* User control and freedom: Users are given limited control over the system to prevent them from making disastrous mistakes, but also gives them the flexibility to control the system within their privileges. Dangerous functions are marked with red backgrounds or labels (e.g. delete buttons) and have warning dialogues to support intention.
 
* Consistency and standards: Using Bootstrap's predefined semantic colour and image scheming, the system has been defined to associate words semantically with actions to follow conventions and standards and reduce possible confusion.
 
* Error prevention: The system attempts error prevention by marking dangerous zones in red, alerting the user before committing a dangerous actions and insisting on a neat page layout to prevent accidental errors or dangerous actions.

* Recognition rather than recall: Visual design consistency across all pages as well as heading sizes and semantic element features allows for the user to have a sense of recognition when using the system rather than recall.

* Flexibility and efficiency of use: Common buttons, actions and elements are situated in appropriate and easy-to-find places, supported by the clean page layout.

* Aesthetic and minimalist design: Elements are shown when they are necessary and appropriate. The interface has been stripped back to encourage minimalism, combined with simple colours and elegance to invoke a sense of aesthetic pleasure.

* Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Error messages are colloquial and supported by background colours appropriate to the error type.
