## User Classes and Characteristics

The users will be able to select their class based on a large list of user types, each with their own permission levels. The user types will fall under either user or administrator depending on the type (i.e. Tour Guides are users while Park Staff are administrators). The account types are differentiated based on occupation, while the privileges are determined by the occupation relation to the system.

To secure the distribution of administrative access, users will have to be verify their identity before they can gain their administrator privileges (if applicable to the given user). This will be verified by the System Administrator.

The user classes are adapted from the provided data base schema, and categorised into administrators and users. The users within the system are as stated below:

* Administrators
	* Employee
* Users
	* Conservation Partner
	* Tour Operator
	* Volunteer
	* Fitness Trainer

The first iteration of the system will contain these classes. The variety will not be expanded at this time for ease of use, and all users who do not fit directly into one of the categories are considered volunteers.

It is most important that the system satisfies all users in direct contact with the Parks and Wildlife Service, while also satisfying the needs of all other users.
