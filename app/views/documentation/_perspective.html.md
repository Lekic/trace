## Product Perspective

The software system specified by this document is the Pest Tracking System for the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service. The system is a newly developed, first iteration system to join the current standing software suite used.

Being web-based, the system has to be able to incorporate completely with other components of the software suite, raising no issues or errors in the integration of the software. The system will be developed as a standalone with extensibility options throughout all tiers (UI, processing and data storage), to allow the Parks and Wildlife Services team to integrate the product as they desire.

For an overview of the overall system, refer to the Deployment Diagram and any other related diagram in the Appendix.
