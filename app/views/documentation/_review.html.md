## Review

During the weekly sprint meetings, methods of working were updated to reflect lessons learnt in the previous sprint. Such lessons included the importance of strictly allocating members to tasks, setting due dates for multiple overlapping cards and finishing overdue tasks first.

During the course of the project, people, processes and tools were also re-evaluated and discovered to automate and enhance our workflow. Trello was added for sprint management and task allocation, Facebook was added for general discussion, Google Drive was added for collaborative documentation and Git was added for version control and collaborative project construction. People were re-allocated to different cards depending on their preference, skill levels and other factors.
