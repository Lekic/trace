## Appearance

### Description

We have identified look and feel as one of the main non-functional requirements because we believe in the importance of creating a good first impression. We want users to look at our system and immediately feel comfortable and willing to interact with it. If the user closes the system because their initial impression is that it looks too confusing or it is not aesthetically pleasing, then the system has already failed. As our system is required to be accessible by several types of users ranging from farmers to national park rangers, our aim is to achieve a simple, intuitive and comfortable design that users from  different technical backgrounds will be comfortable with. 

The overall look of the system will be relatively professional (being a government-run system), however we’re aiming for a casual feel in terms of colour scheme, layout and general usage. This requirement also takes into account the fact that our system should be typically aesthetically pleasing. Consistent fonts, sizes, layout and colour schemes are integral to building a system with modern design standards. As this system is web-based, another primary concern of ours is handling a perfect responsive design. As the usage of our system is leaning more towards mobile devices (but also respects tablets and desktops), our interface must be built to handle every device resolution and look as structured as it does on desktops.

### Scope

The impression that users have when using the system is a major consideration to the system as a whole. It acts as a rough measure of how effective the new system is and how the users feel while using the product. The look and feel encompasses the whole front-end design.

### Technical issues

There are 2 main issues that arise when designing the look and feel of the system. The first is to be realistic, as its bad practice to develop an interface that’s almost impossible to build in code. The second is standards / compatibility - the system’s design has to respect the current technical standards and be compatible with as many devices as possible. Creating a design that takes a lot of processing power to render is bad practice as it will not perform well on mobile and tablet devices (which are an ever-increasing audience).

### Risks

A poorly designed interface with an uncomfortable feel will sway users from using the system and compromise the effort put into the rest of the project, resulting in decreased productivity and use of the app.
