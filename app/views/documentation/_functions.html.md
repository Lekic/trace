## Product Functions

The Pest Tracking System is comprised of 4 subsystems that detail its core competencies: the pest, user, sighting, and reporting subsystems. The subsystems work interdependently are responsible for performing all pest, sighting and reporting functions. These functions together comprise the core functionality of the pest tracking system.

The pest subsystem provides the functionality to create, read, update and delete information on pests. The user subsystem, similarly, allows for the creation, reading, updating and deleting of all user information. The sighting and reporting subsystems allow for the creation, reading and updating of their respective content, though do not allow deletion.

The functionality is not given to all user levels. It is limited through a privilege level scheme, allowing certain operations to only be performed by administrators. This includes the updating of users, and the updating of information submitted by others.
