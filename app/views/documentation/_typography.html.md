## Typography

The original version of the system included 2 fonts: Open Sans and Montserrat. Open Sans is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson. It is free under Open Source license, containing the complete 897 character set and is provided by Google Web Fonts. It was used for all headings and body text with weight differentiation. Montserrat was used bold marketing material such as the landing page.

Since the original version, both fonts have been scrapped in favour of a Helvetica font-stack. It's large range of font weights and elegant lettering make it a perfect font for the system. It also alleviates the dependency of loading custom fonts from a content delivery network.
