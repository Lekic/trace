## Acceptance

As well as the back-end testing, we had to perform testing on the front-end, both operational and appeal-based. As we have implemented a MVC architecture, all functional testing in terms of the front-end is performed through unit and regression testing, which were previously discussed. The main component of front-end testing is the user acceptance testing.

When we talk about user acceptance testing, we speak in regards to the look and feel of the system when used by users, which was one of our key non-functional requirements. To ensure the system was fulfilling our desired paradox of simple complexity, we had implemented all the features and ran through several UAT iterations, ensuring users could operate the system completely and easily.

User Acceptance tests were established by cross-referencing the aforementioned user stories against the current system status. As we have ensured that all user stories are implemented, this information can be correlated with new user tests performed by the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service to further enhance the system look and feel if desired.
