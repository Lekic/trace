## Database Thesis

For the database, we have implemented the original schema as supplied by the Parks and Wildlife Service and expanded on it. We wanted to ensure that we did not affect the original system, as we cannot guarantee that the tables present in the supplied schema do not possess relations with other out-of-scope system components. The expansion on the provided schema ensures that pre existing systems will not be broken by the implementation of the new Pest Tracking System.

The system will continuously grow with the new information added by each user. We believe the current Parks and Wildlife data centre would be suffice for original storage. In terms of bandwidth, we believe it would be best to cater for a high volume of users, and the processing speeds of the proposed system would make this possible without delays.

As for testing the system, we will be running the system through stress tests to ensure it can reach the required processing speeds. We will also be releasing iterations of the UI and running it through User Acceptance testing.

The proposed system architecture ultimately provides the most time and cost efficient solution, while meeting all functionality requirements of the Parks and Wildlife Service's proposed system. We believe that this would be the greatest fit. Finally, we will provide all the required documentation, including the modified database schemas, the installation and operational documentation.
