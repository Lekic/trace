## Allocation

During the first few weeks, each individual was allowed to allocate themselves tasks on Trello. This helped determine their pro-activeness and skills. After these were clearly defined, the Project Manager took to allocating tasks to each individual based on their input level and skills. Task allocation was very flexible to account for any unforeseen circumstances, where other members of the group could join the task when they had completed their own. Each member was responsible for their tasks and were liable if their tasks weren't completed.
