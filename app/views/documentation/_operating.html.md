## Operating Environment

The software will be platform independent and work on desktop, tablet and mobile environments. It will work on all major operating systems (Windows, OS X, Linux), as well as all mobile platforms (iOS, Android, Blackberry). The minimum hardware requirements for the system are the same as for the browser that it is using, considering it will be a web-based application. Hence, both Intel and AMD CPUs, as well as both Nvidia and ATI graphics cards will be fully compatible with the system.

Some areas of the interface will respond quicker with a high-end graphics card as the animation processing is offloaded to the GPU, but this is not a requirement.

For detailed requirements of the system, check the system requirements of the web browser it will be used in.
