## Maintainability

### Description

After completion of the system, maintenance and support will have to continue to take place. Our aim is to provide a system that has the smallest learning curve possible, through the use of an intuitive interface and clear, concise and easy to understand procedures and operations. To ensure that the system is easily understood, we will involve clients that will be using the system in the design and testing phases both for their opinions and to have them learning the core dependencies of the system along the way. The majority of support will be based on the help documentation embedded in the system.

### Scope

The maintainability and support is relevant to the system as a whole as the system will be administered completely by the company. 

### Technical issues

None. The system should be fully functional by this time.

### Risks

The training on the system may be a hindrance depending on the ease of understanding by the appropriate staff.
