## Visual Elements

Most elements in this system inherit their styles from Bootstrap 3.0.1. In summary, the following CSS elements are pre-styled by Bootstrap with only minor modifications for our specific system:

* Tables
* Forms
* Buttons
* Dropdowns
* Buttons
* Form controls
* Navigation
* Breadcrumbs
* Pagination
* Labels
* Badges
* Jumbotron
* Page header
* Thumbnails
* Alerts
* Progress bars
* Media object
* List group
* Panels
* Wells

We also implemented Chosen to complement the intuitive element styling of Bootstrap, allowing select elements to be filtered and searched with custom styles.
