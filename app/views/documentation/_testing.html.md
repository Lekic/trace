## Testing Thesis

System testing is an integral part of any software project. But why do we need to perform testing.

We perform testing for a multitude of reasons. It allows us to test that our system has met the requirements of our client through certain test cases. It also provides us with a way to ensure the system quality in a few aspects. We can use certain testing methods to ensure the system can integrate well with other systems; as well as assess the resource usage of the system itself, and itâ€™s maximum potential load. Throughout every stage of testing, we can also find bugs that affect anything from core dependencies, to something as odd as breaking functionality due to completely independent components.

In regards to the NSW PAWS system, we decided on a few testing methods that we deemed cover the whole testing spectrum: unit testing, regression testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing, and stress testing. We believe that together these forms of testing can ensure the system meets all requirements, demonstrates the systems maintainability and scalability, and ultimately shows the system is ready for deployment.
