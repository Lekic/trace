## Layout

The basic layout for all pages consists of a navigation bar, content wrapper and footer. Each holds a responsive, fixed-width container generated by Bootstrap. The content wrapper's container allows for a 12-column flexible grid system which is used on almost all pages. The entire page is covered by media queries which dictate how the containers and grid system react to a change in screen size.
