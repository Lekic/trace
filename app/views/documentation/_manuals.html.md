## Manuals

The NSW Parks and Wildlife Service will be provided with various forms of system manuals to support the system, as well as provide the users of the system with simple instructions to use the system. The supporting documentation includes:

* All development documentation including the requirements elicitation, system architecture, system design and rationale, meeting minutes, sprint retrospectives and project schedule.
* Thorough system documentation including class and method usage instructions and operation descriptions.
* Administrative documentation including installation guides for all system dependencies and operational guides detailing how to administer the system.
* User documentation both embedded into the website through means of on-hover information and help/support pages, as well as usage documentation supplied to the Parks and Wildlife Service.

### Training Manual

The training manual is documentation directed towards the admins and developers required to maintain the system and to support users.

Admin Tasks revolves around managing information within the system and getting admin permissions. This includes managing users, reports, pests, and sightings. Instructions on how to do these tasks are provided because of the data centric nature of the system. This ensures that the admin has the knowledge required to control the system completely in the situation that issues arise.

Developer Tasks involve the back-end development of the system. This includes implementing gems into the system, and database management and development. This provides developers the capability to scale the system for future expansions, features and visual upgrades.

### Getting Started Guide

Getting Started details the initial tasks required for the users and the admins to perform in order ot fulfill the purpose of the system.

This teaches users how to do primary functions such as registering into the system, reporting a sighting, opening sightings in the database as well as searching up sightings within the system.

Initial admin tasks are focused on setting up admin accounts and user permissions that populate the system to get the system to run.

Developer tasks are instructions on how to migrate the original database from the Parks and Wildlife system in order to populate the database to the new system. Furthermore, installation guide for implementing gems are included to develop the system to provide all the features that ensure the smooth operation of the system.
