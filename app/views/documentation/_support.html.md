## Support Documentation Thesis

Support and Documentation encompasses system operation from a user, admin and developer standpoint. We have divided this into 4 aspects, installation which deals with how to install the System as well as specific components that fine-tune the system to the User's needs, Training Manual provides information for the admins and developers that are necessary for system maintenance and user support, Getting Started explains the core tasks that the users and admins have to do in order to fulfills the purpose of the system, FAQ/Help and Support details more specific tasks that the user may come across though aren't necessary for the system functionality.

We have chosen these 4 aspects in order for future developers to install the system completely through our operations whilst minimize the learning curve for swift deployment and operation as well as intricate instructions for further expansion, support and maintenance. 

There are some instances where the Admin and Developer have access to the same data. Guides for each user type are provided that allow each to manage the relevant sections.

Getting Started, Help and Support, FAQs and System Manuals will be provided to the NSW Parks and Wildlife upon system implementation.

### FAQ

FAQ or Help and Support details more specific tasks that aren't core functions however these functions maintain system quality and accurate. This is directed towards the user and the technical language used is next to none as to cater to a wide userbase and is accessible on the web interface as a forum-based page. Key tasks are pre-populated and will continually grow as more user contribute to the forum.

These tasks are primarily the updating, and deleting information from the system which may be outdated.

### System Manuals

The NSW Parks and Wildlife Service will be provided with various forms of system manuals to support the system, as well as provide the users of the system with simple instructions to use the system. The supporting documentation includes:

* All development documentation including the requirements elicitation, system architecture, system design and rationale, meeting minutes, sprint retrospectives and project schedule.
* Thorough system documentation including class and method usage instructions and operation descriptions.
* Administrative documentation including installation guides for all system dependencies and operational guides detailing how to administer the system.
* User documentation both embedded into the website through means of on-hover information and help/support pages, as well as usage documentation supplied to the Parks and Wildlife Service.

### Training Manual

The training manual is documentation directed towards the admins and developers required to maintain the system and to support users.

Admin Tasks revolves around managing information within the system and getting admin permissions. This includes managing users, reports, pests, and sightings. Instructions on how to do these tasks are provided because of the data centric nature of the system. This ensures that the admin has the knowledge required to control the system completely in the situation that issues arise.

Developer Tasks involve the back-end development of the system. This includes implementing gems into the system, and database management and development. This provides developers the capability to scale the system for future expansions, features and visual upgrades.

### Getting Started Guide

Getting Started details the initial tasks required for the users and the admins to perform in order ot fulfill the purpose of the system.

This teaches users how to do primary functions such as registering into the system, reporting a sighting, opening sightings in the database as well as searching up sightings within the system.

Initial admin tasks are focused on setting up admin accounts and user permissions that populate the system to get the system to run.

Developer tasks are instructions on how to migrate the original database from the Parks and Wildlife system in order to populate the database to the new system. Furthermore, installation guide for implementing gems are included to develop the system to provide all the features that ensure the smooth operation of the system.
