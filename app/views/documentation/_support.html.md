## Support Documentation Thesis

Support and Documentation encompasses system operation from a user, admin and developer standpoint. We have divided this into 4 aspects, installation which deals with how to install the System as well as specific components that fine-tune the system to the User's needs, Training Manual provides information for the admins and developers that are necessary for system maintenance and user support, Getting Started explains the core tasks that the users and admins have to do in order to fulfills the purpose of the system, FAQ/Help and Support details more specific tasks that the user may come across though aren't necessary for the system functionality.

We have chosen these 4 aspects in order for future developers to install the system completely through our operations whilst minimize the learning curve for swift deployment and operation as well as intricate instructions for further expansion, support and maintenance. 

There are some instances where the Admin and Developer have access to the same data. Guides for each user type are provided that allow each to manage the relevant sections.
