## Platform

We chose the web as our platform for distribution due to the power, scalability and compatibility that come with a responsive web application. Our team was already proficient in building large-scale applications and the system was required to run on tablets, phones, laptops and desktops. Alternatives included creating a native iOS or Android application.
