## Environmental Consideration

### Description

The first release of the system to be developed will be run from the provided UTS servers. Those servers must provide a maximum uptime to cater for all user’s presence, as well as the running of background processes. These include analytics, metrics, data mining and auditing. As for the environmental aspect, this mainly concerns the server storage room, and keeping the servers in a static-free, dust-free and secure environment.

### Scope

This requirement encompasses the installation and implementation of the system on the UTS servers. The need to revisit these considerations will arise near the end of the project.

### Technical Issues

As we are using the UTS servers to host our system, the most apparent issue is compatibility with hardware and software in the existing operational environment. As it’s a web system, however, the primary concern is running the system parallel with UTS’ other systems, so as not to disrupt their processes.

### Risks

The system could interfere with UTS’ existing systems. The system could interfere with the Parks and Wildlife systems. The server may go down as a result of hardware or software issues which may lead to a loss or corruption of data. Unauthorised access to the servers.
