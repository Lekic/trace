## Purpose

This document is compiled to detail the software requirements for the Feral Pest Tracking System (FPTS), which is to be implemented by New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (PWS). This is the first revision (Revision 1.0) of the document and will detail all requirements that have been extrapolated thus far.

The FPTS is a system that will be integrated into the pre-existing software suite operated by the PWS. This document however only details the FPTS directly and does not include any information of systems outside the scope of this system; for example, the payroll system.
