## Cultural and Political Concerns

### Description

As the system will be available to a wide range of people in Australia it is important to identify any cultural concerns in the system. The system could viably be used (if a user has the rights) to locate places with pests in which hunting is not banned. Reporting pests and storing information of the users (assuming non-disclosure of important details) is legal and has no negative ramifications. There are no known laws this system will interfere with, as it is a system being built to assist government recognised authorities.

The system must be intuitive and simple enough to cater to all users, regardless of culture or disability. While this will undoubtedly require extra time for the development of the system, it is a necessary task to ensure universal accessibility.

### Scope

These concerns may affect the users of the system. However due to the fact the system incurs no legal or political infringements, the only type of issue that might occur would be culturally dependent. Since Australia does not have a strong game hunting culture there should be no large scale issues due to this requirement.

### Technical Issues

Because of the different types of account restrictions, the only people who can exploit the system are administrators to the system. Due to the nature of administrators (Park rangers etc.) this kind of exploitation is highly unlikely.

### Risks

Hunting in Australia is already inhibited by reasonable strict laws, including requiring a permit from the game council. As of October 2012 a no-hunting program has been scheduled to begin in a number of national parks in Australia, which may inhibit the game culture. Should any hunters wish to find a place where they may hunt certain pests, the system could potentially be used to find places they exist in which are not covered by the new hunting laws. Furthermore, from a user's perspective, if the staff reject the new system, it will be deprecated and result in a decrease in productivity.
