## Legal Concerns and Open Source Code

### Description

We aim to use open source code and plugins throughout the design, development, implementation and maintenance of the software at hand. Having an open source arsenal of software means there are no surprise costs to the business such as having to pay for licensing rights both during and after the project (for potential maintenance).

### Scope

The use of open source and freeware will be implemented throughout the whole system to ensure that there is no extra cost to the business, unless the business desires otherwise.

### Technical issues

The main issue with open source and freeware is that it may not be as fully-fledged as the paid software. To overcome this issue we will have to find software most tailored to our requirements for planning, development and implementation.

### Risks

As with most open-source and freeware, there is a lack of support given; meaning we will have to self-educate on the workings of the system as well as be prepared to deal with any bugs that may present themselves.
