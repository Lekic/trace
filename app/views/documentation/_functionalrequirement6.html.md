## The system can accommodate various types of sightings

### Preconditions

A pest is tracked or sighted. The user is logged in. The user has opted to create a sighting. User has relevant permissions to create a sighting.

### Required for

Pest sightings to be reported from a different number of sources and mediums.

### Description

Different types of pests require different methods of tracking. Therefore it is expected of the system to be able to register pest sightings from different sources such as GPS collars fitted onto pests, fixed infrared cameras, from farmers who have shot a pest, sightings of livestock attacks and overall general sightings and observations. Sightings from tracking devices and fixed infrared cameras are to be uploaded to the system automatically, while general sightings will be added to the system manually using the interface we build.

### Inputs

Raw data that is to be uploaded to the system automatically from tracking devices / cameras or data from sightings reported manually by a user.

### Process

If a pest is tracked or sighted on camera, data describing the pest’s location is uploaded to the system automatically. If pest is manually sighted, the sighting is either reported over the phone or the user opts to report the sighting themselves using the web system interface.

### Output

Pest sightings are recorded into the system from different types of sources.

### Exceptions

On a fairly low probability, the user wants to create a pest sighting using a medium that is not offered by the interface. However, it’s likely that most mediums will fall under the general category of “manually reported user sightings”.

### Scope

The system’s capability to accept sightings and reports from various mediums and sources is one of the most fundamental aspects of the system. It is imperative that the system is able to work seamlessly with the existing methods of pest tracking so that the workflow of Parks & Wildlife is not disrupted. This means that users of the existing manual system must be able to incorporate this new web system into their workflow.

### Technical issues

The only real technical issue is creating the system so the various methods of recording pest sightings can be increased or modified over time. The automatic uploading of data from infrared cameras and GPS collars is not bundled with the system automatically due to technical skill levels and time constraints.

### Risks

There are no real risks for this requirement.
