## Tools

The two project management tools chosen - Trello and GitHub - were well thought out and justifiable. Git was chosen as a version control system above Mercurial or Subversion due to it’s ease of use, scalability, flexibility. The choice between issue tracking / version control system was more difficult, with options like Trak, Bitbucket and Gyro offering useful tools. GitHub was chosen due to it’s complete and simple integration with Git (specifically when using the GitHub software for Windows / Mac). This also flattened the learning curve for the less experience members of the group.

Trello was chosen as our task management tool above something like JIRA due to it’s stark simplicity. Due to the relatively short length of the project, we needed a system that would let us easily manage tasks without getting in the way. While lacking a few trivial features, Trello provided a great way to manage tasks.
