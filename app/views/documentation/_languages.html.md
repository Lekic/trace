## Languages (also justify)

### HAML

Rather than writing HTML, the system is built on a precompiled HTML substitute called HAML (HTML Abstraction Markup Language). Deprecating closing elements and tag syntax, HAML provided a simpler way of producing markup via. indentation and CSS-style syntax. Since the system is built on Ruby, HAML is compiled to HTML using Ruby.

### SASS

Similar to the HTML substitute, the systemâ€™s CSS is also precompiled using a language called SASS. This allows for nested CSS rules and other helpful improvements that are compiled through Ruby to CSS.

### CoffeeScript

Similar again to the first two examples, JavaScript is precompiled using Ruby and CoffeeScript. It provides a lightweight alternative to producing lengthy JavaScript and helps endorse well structured code like HAML.
