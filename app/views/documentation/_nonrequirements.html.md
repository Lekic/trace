## Non-Requirements (out of scope)

Out of scope requirements include things that are not necessary in the completion of this project, however they were discussed as potential additions to the system at a later stage. These include:

* Input from tracking sources e.g. surveillance camera or tracking collars
* Geolocation / GPS
* Native mobile application e.g. iPhone or Android application
* Full system implementation for the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service.
