## Usability

### Description

The new system is an auxiliary system, not a replacement system of the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Department's current infrastructure. Users who utilise the system won't be hindered by a steep learning curve and will feel natural when using the system. Rather than replacing the current manual system, the new system must create an efficient workflow for the existing users to share, collaborate and learn. The main concern for this requirement is unbiased usability. The new system should feel like an extension of the manual system currently used and feel casual and natural, allowing existing users to immediately start using the new system with no training or technical expertise.

The system has to be usable to the system and user-friendly and usable by different people of multiple technical backgrounds. Any completely new and unprecedented features should be immediately understandable with the help section as a fallback. As an example, animal's entries should be pre-tagged with certain characteristics to be identified rather than a specific identification name or code. This allows the user to specify the sighting without needing to know specific details of the animal such as its name. Identifying pests without having to know their specific names is a necessity when the user only knows certain features such as colour, size, animal, location, narrowing down the possible pest that the user encountered. This provides leeway for users who are not completely knowledgeable with the pests but still be able to contribute in a meaningful fashion to the system.

Furthermore, using the vague descriptions that the users have, the data entered into the system can still be considered valid and comprehensible by the back-end. The user is given a list of attributes to tick. Some options are greyed out and a dependant list picking style is used to narrow down the options. Once the correct pest has been narrowed down, it is selected by the users to be input into the system. Selecting the correct pest in the sighting maintains the integrity of the data entered into the system. Minimal data entry is also a requirement given by the current users for the new system. 

### Scope

Usability and humanity covers the front-end design of the system, but also the layout and architecture of the system.

### Technical issues

While we aim to create an unbiased, immediately understandable design, it is not possible to please all users with the design.

### Risks

The only risk is users believing that this system is too difficult to use and would rather manually report sightings. In relation to the example, users who have not provided sufficient information may be left with multiple options of pests. If the user opts to guess which pest they found, this may cause inaccuracies in the collective data.
