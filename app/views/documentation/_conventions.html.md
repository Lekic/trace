## Document Conventions

The document will maintain the conventions and typography standards adopted by our team. The typographical conventions are: a Helvetica Light 11pt standard body, numbered Helvetica Light 16pt main headings, numbered Helvetica Light 13pt sub headings, italicised key points and bolded sub-points.

The logical conventions of the document are such that all higher level requirements are also required by their more specific child requirements. Child requirements will have priorities no higher than the total of their parent requirement, though can be equal. All child requirements also logically inherit the parentâ€™s fundamental requirements.
