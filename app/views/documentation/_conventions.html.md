## Document Conventions

The document will maintain the conventions and typography standards adopted by our team. The typographical conventions, derived from Bootstrap, are:

* Level 1 Headings: Helvetica Neue 36px
* Level 2 Headings: Helvetica Neue 31px
* Level 3 Headings: Helvetica Neue 24px
* Standard Body: Helvetica Neue 14px

The logical conventions of the document are such that all higher level requirements are also required by their more specific child requirements. Child requirements will have priorities no higher than the total of their parent requirement, though can be equal. All child requirements also logically inherit the parent's fundamental requirements.
